    <p>This SRT editor allows you to edit SRT subtitle files for movies. The editor runs as a webserver, but it only works if it's running on your local machine. The advantage of this is that it can access
        your local files without having to upload them to the server. The advantage of it running as a webserver is, that it can use all features available to either server side program, or a browser.

    <p>Before you start working on a movie, you need to create a project. The project data specifies where to find the movie and the subtitle files for the languages you want to support.</p>
